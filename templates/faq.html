        const investingFAQs = [
            {
                question: "Why should I invest?",
                answer: "Investing helps you grow your wealth over time, beat inflation, and achieve long-term financial goals like retirement, buying a home, or funding education. By investing wisely, you can potentially earn higher returns compared to traditional savings accounts."
            },
            {
                question: "What is an investment?",
                answer: "An investment is allocating money into assets like stocks, bonds, mutual funds, real estate, or other financial instruments with the expectation of generating income or appreciation in value over time. The goal is to increase your wealth and financial security."
            },
            {
                question: "How do I start investing with little money?",
                answer: "You can start investing with small amounts through options like micro-investing apps, fractional shares, low-cost index funds, employer-sponsored retirement plans, or automated robo-advisors. Many platforms now allow you to begin with as little as $5 or $10."
            },
            {
                question: "What's the difference between stocks and bonds?",
                answer: "Stocks represent ownership in a company, offering potentially higher returns but with greater risk. Bonds are loans to companies or governments, generally providing lower but more stable returns. Stocks focus on growth and sometimes dividends, while bonds provide regular interest payments."
            },
            {
                question: "What is diversification and why is it important?",
                answer: "Diversification means spreading your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate), industries, and geographic regions. It's important because it reduces risk by ensuring that a downturn in one area won't devastate your entire portfolio."
            },
            {
                question: "What is compound interest?",
                answer: "Compound interest is when you earn interest on both your initial investment and on the interest you've already earned. This creates a snowball effect that accelerates your wealth growth over time, especially with longer investment horizons."
            }
        ];

        const budgetingFAQs = [
            {
                question: "What is a budget?",
                answer: "A budget is a financial plan that outlines your expected income and expenses over a specific period. It helps you track spending, control costs, allocate funds to different categories, and ensure you're living within your means."
            },
            {
                question: "How much should I save each month?",
                answer: "A good rule of thumb is to save 20% of your income. This can be split between emergency funds, retirement accounts, and other financial goals. However, the exact amount depends on your income, expenses, and personal financial objectives."
            },
            {
                question: "What is the 50/30/20 budget rule?",
                answer: "The 50/30/20 rule suggests allocating 50% of your after-tax income to needs (housing, food, utilities), 30% to wants (entertainment, dining out), and 20% to savings and debt repayment. This simple framework helps create a balanced approach to spending and saving."
            },
            {
                question: "How much should I have in an emergency fund?",
                answer: "Most financial experts recommend having 3-6 months' worth of essential expenses saved in an easily accessible emergency fund. If you have variable income or work in unstable industries, consider saving 6-12 months' worth."
            },
            {
                question: "How do I track my expenses effectively?",
                answer: "You can track expenses using budgeting apps like Mint or YNAB, spreadsheets, traditional pen and paper, or through your bank's expense categorization tools. The key is consistency and regularly reviewing your spending to identify patterns and areas for improvement."
            },
            {
                question: "How can I reduce my monthly expenses?",
                answer: "To reduce monthly expenses: review and cancel unused subscriptions, negotiate bills like insurance and internet, meal plan to reduce food costs, use cashback apps and coupons, reduce energy usage, refinance high-interest debt, and consider downsizing housing if appropriate."
            }
        ];

        const creditFAQs = [
            {
                question: "How can I improve my credit score?",
                answer: "To improve your credit score: pay bills on time, reduce credit card balances, avoid opening too many new credit accounts, maintain a mix of credit types, regularly check your credit report for errors, and keep old accounts open to establish a longer credit history."
            },
            {
                question: "What is a good credit score?",
                answer: "Credit score ranges vary slightly between scoring models, but generally: Excellent: 800-850, Very Good: 740-799, Good: 670-739, Fair: 580-669, and Poor: Below 580. A score above 700 is typically considered good and will qualify you for favorable loan terms."
            },
            {
                question: "How does credit card interest work?",
                answer: "Credit card interest is calculated based on your average daily balance and is expressed as an Annual Percentage Rate (APR). If you don't pay your full balance by the due date, interest is charged on the remaining amount. Interest compounds, meaning you'll pay interest on previously accrued interest."
            },
            {
                question: "What is the avalanche method of debt repayment?",
                answer: "The avalanche method involves prioritizing debts with the highest interest rates first, while making minimum payments on other debts. This approach minimizes the total interest paid and time to become debt-free, though it may take longer to completely pay off individual debts."
            },
            {
                question: "What is the snowball method of debt repayment?",
                answer: "The snowball method involves paying off your smallest debts first, regardless of interest rate, while making minimum payments on other debts. As each small debt is paid off, you redirect that payment to the next smallest debt. This method provides psychological wins that can help maintain motivation."
            },
            {
                question: "How do balance transfers work?",
                answer: "A balance transfer moves debt from one credit card to another, typically one with a lower interest rate or a 0% promotional rate. This can save on interest costs, but usually involves a one-time transfer fee (3-5% of the amount transferred). The promotional rate expires after a set period, typically 12-18 months."
            }
        ];

        const retirementFAQs = [
            {
                question: "How much do I need to save for retirement?",
                answer: "A common guideline is to save enough to replace 70-80% of your pre-retirement income. Using the 4% rule, multiply your annual expenses by 25 to estimate the total needed. For example, if you need $60,000 annually, aim for $1.5 million in retirement savings."
            },
            {
                question: "What is the difference between a 401(k) and an IRA?",
                answer: "A 401(k) is an employer-sponsored retirement plan with higher contribution limits and potential employer matching. An IRA (Individual Retirement Account) is opened individually with more investment options but lower contribution limits. Both offer tax advantages but differ in rules, limits, and withdrawal options."
            },
            {
                question: "What is the difference between a Roth and traditional retirement account?",
                answer: "Traditional accounts offer tax deductions now but taxable withdrawals in retirement. Roth accounts use after-tax contributions with tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Traditional accounts benefit those in higher tax brackets now who expect lower rates in retirement, while Roth accounts benefit those expecting higher future tax rates."
            },
            {
                question: "When should I start saving for retirement?",
                answer: "Start saving for retirement as early as possible to maximize compound growth. Ideally, begin with your first job. If you start later, you'll need to save a higher percentage of your income. Even small contributions early in your career can grow significantly over decades."
            },
            {
                question: "What is Social Security and how does it work?",
                answer: "Social Security is a government program providing retirement, disability, and survivor benefits. You contribute through payroll taxes during your working years. Retirement benefits are based on your highest 35 years of earnings, with full benefits available at your full retirement age (66-67 for most people today)."
            },
            {
                question: "What is a Required Minimum Distribution (RMD)?",
                answer: "A Required Minimum Distribution is the minimum amount you must withdraw annually from certain retirement accounts (like traditional IRAs and 401(k)s) once you reach a certain age (73 as of 2024, increasing to 75 by 2033). The amount is calculated based on your account balance and life expectancy."
            }
        ];

        const taxFAQs = [
            {
                question: "What's the difference between a tax deduction and a tax credit?",
                answer: "A tax deduction reduces your taxable income before calculating taxes owed, so its value depends on your tax bracket. A tax credit directly reduces your tax bill dollar-for-dollar, making it generally more valuable. For example, a $1,000 deduction in the 22% bracket saves $220, while a $1,000 credit saves $1,000."
            },
            {
                question: "How can I legally reduce my tax burden?",
                answer: "Legal tax reduction strategies include: maximizing retirement contributions, using tax-advantaged accounts like HSAs, taking advantage of tax deductions and credits, investing in tax-efficient funds, strategic tax-loss harvesting, charitable giving, and timing income and expenses strategically."
            },
            {
                question: "What tax forms do I need to file?",
                answer: "Most individuals file Form 1040 for federal taxes. Additional forms depend on your situation: Schedule A for itemized deductions, Schedule B for interest/dividends, Schedule C for self-employment, Schedule D for capital gains, Schedule E for rental income, and various forms for education expenses, healthcare, and retirement accounts."
            },
            {
                question: "What is capital gains tax?",
                answer: "Capital gains tax applies to profits from selling assets like stocks, real estate, or collectibles. Short-term gains (assets held less than a year) are taxed as ordinary income. Long-term gains (assets held over a year) receive preferential rates: 0%, 15%, or 20% depending on your income level."
            },
            {
                question: "Should I itemize deductions or take the standard deduction?",
                answer: "Itemize deductions if their total exceeds the standard deduction ($14,600 for single filers, $29,200 for married filing jointly in 2024). Common itemized deductions include mortgage interest, state and local taxes (limited to $10,000), medical expenses exceeding 7.5% of AGI, and charitable donations."
            },
            {
                question: "How does tax withholding work?",
                answer: "Tax withholding is when your employer deducts estimated taxes from your paycheck and sends them to the government. Your W-4 form determines the amount withheld. Proper withholding ensures you won't owe a large sum at tax time or provide an interest-free loan to the government through a large refund."
